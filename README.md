This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview
This project is a book library application, built using Next.js and various other technologies. The application allows users to browse and manage a collection of books.

## Technologies/Frameworks/Library Used
 - Next.js: A popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated websites and applications.
 - TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features.
 - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom user interfaces.
 - Shadcn: A design system and component library for building web applications, built on top of Chakra UI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
